## Ever Seen This Before?

- final_project.doc
- final_project_v2.doc
- final_project_FINAL.doc
- final_project_FINAL_REALLY.doc

We usually version our files this way. It’s messy, confusing, and easy to lose track!

## There’s a Better Way

Manually saving multiple versions leads to:
1. Confusion about which version is the latest
2. Risk of accidental overwrites or lost work
3. No clear record of who changed what and why
4. Difficult collaboration across teams

What if there was a system that **automatically tracked changes**, helped you **collaborate safely**, and let you go back in time when needed?

Answer is **Version Control**
